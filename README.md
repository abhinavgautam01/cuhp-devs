CUHP Devs is a coding practice and student developer community platform organized as a Turbo + pnpm monorepo. It combines a Next.js frontend, an Express API, a Socket.IO realtime service, MongoDB-backed shared data models, and a local problem pipeline for coding challenges with generated multi-language boilerplate.

The repository is no longer a generic Turborepo starter. It already contains implemented flows for authentication, onboarding/profile setup, dashboard views, problem practice, realtime chat rooms, community posts/snippets, resources, settings, and public developer profiles.

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> A student developer platform that combines coding practice, public profiles, community interaction, realtime chat, and curated learning resources in one monorepo.

- Built with Express + TypeScript.
- Exposes REST endpoints for auth, users, problems, submissions, code execution, languages, and posts.
- Uses JWT in cookies for auth.
- Uses Zod for request validation in the auth flow.
- Starts a background result worker after MongoDB connection is ready.

#### Socket Service
![Socket.IO](https://img.shields.io/badge/Socket.IO-Realtime-010101?style=flat-square&logo=socketdotio&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-Change_Streams-47A248?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

- Separate realtime service using Socket.IO.
- Authenticates sockets before connection.
- Handles chat room join/leave flows, member presence, room stats, typing events, message send/delete, and room creation.
- Watches Mongo post inserts with change streams and broadcasts new posts when supported by MongoDB.

#### Problems Catalog
![Boilerplate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Boilerplate-Generated-2563EB?style=flat-square)
![Testcases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Testcases-Local-059669?style=flat-square)

- Stores coding challenge assets locally.
- Each problem can contain `Problem.md`, `Structure.md`, testcase input/output files, and generated language boilerplates.
- Example problem folders in the repo show the expected structure for challenge authoring.

### Shared Packages

#### `packages/ui`
- Shared UI library used by the web app.
- Contains reusable section UIs for dashboard, practice, community, auth, navigation, settings, and profile overview.
- Includes Monaco editor integration and markdown rendering utilities.

#### `packages/db`
- Shared Mongoose connection, models, schemas, interfaces, and enums.
- Includes scripts for syncing problems, updating problem data, and seeding testcases into MongoDB.

#### `packages/boilerplate-generator`
- Parses a problem `Structure.md` file.
- Generates starter boilerplate and full executable wrappers for C++, Rust, Python, and JavaScript.
- Supports generation for one problem slug or for all problems in the local catalog.

## Known Gaps and Current Problems

> [!WARNING]
> Some sections are fully wired, while others still rely on mocked payloads, staged UI, or infrastructure assumptions such as MongoDB replica-set support for change streams.

This README should reflect the code honestly, so these limitations are worth calling out:

- The current `README.md` previously lagged behind the actual product and still looked like a starter repo.
- Some dashboard, community, and resources content is still mocked or partially hardcoded.
- Practice category filtering is not fully backed by resolved tag metadata yet.
- The visible practice `Submit` button is ahead of the fully polished end-to-end submission UX in the page layer.
- Mongo change stream based post broadcasting works only when MongoDB is configured appropriately.
- A few UI sections are clearly scaffolded for future growth, especially side widgets and some resources/settings capabilities.

## Scripts

![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run-pnpm_install-059669?style=flat-square)
![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run-pnpm_build-059669?style=flat-square)
![Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run-pnpm_dev-2563EB?style=flat-square)
![Lint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run-pnpm_lint-D97706?style=flat-square)
![Types](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run-pnpm_check--types-7C3AED?style=flat-square)

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev
pnpm lint
pnpm check-types
```

Problem and DB utility scripts:

```bash
pnpm generate-boilerplate
pnpm problem-update:db
pnpm problems-sync:db
pnpm testcases-push:db
```

## Local Services

| Service | Default Port |
| --- | --- |
| Web app | `http://localhost:3000` |
| HTTP backend | `http://localhost:3001` |
| Socket server | `http://localhost:4001` |

## Development Notes

- The workspace uses `pnpm` and `turbo` from the repo root.
- The backend and socket apps depend on the shared `@repo/db` package.
- The web app expects the backend and socket services to be available for full functionality.
- The project includes local problem assets and scripts, so the coding platform is not just UI-only; it already includes challenge content, default code generation, and execution plumbing.
